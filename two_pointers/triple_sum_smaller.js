/*

Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it such that arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target where i, j, and k are three different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.


example:
[3, 1, 2, 6, 7] target = 10
answers : [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 6]
return 2;

Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
